## Gather Feedback:

## Implement Changes:
- I changed the colour scheme to fit the hot beans colour scheme with a brown colours to make it look like different beans to make it fit with the company name and made the button more visible by changing the colour to a light brown colour than the colour behind it to make it stand out more.
